# synmorph_DVEmigration

This repository contains the code to reproduce active vertex simulations in "Behavioural and mechanical heterogeneities control the cell migration that establishes axial asymmetries in the mouse embryo" Stower et al., 2023. 

The model was created, code was written, and analysis was performed by Jake Cornwall-Scoones, supervised by Prof. James Briscoe (Crick Institute). 

The code base was adapted from an existing code base that was written by Jake Cornwall-Scoones with Prof. Matthew Thomson (Caltech). 

For any questions about the operation or elaboration of the code base, please contact Jake Cornwall-Scoones (https://www.crick.ac.uk/research/find-a-researcher/jake-cornwall-scoones).
